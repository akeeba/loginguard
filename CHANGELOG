Akeeba LoginGuard 5.0.0
================================================================================
~ Rewritten with core Joomla MVC
~ Do not ask for TSV if the only active method is backup codes (e.g. after admin has unpublished the previously used plugin)
~ Joomla changed the location of the cacert.pem file
+ Added support for Joomla Privacy Suite in Joomla 4
# [HIGH] Backup codes not removed after removing the last TSV method.
# [HIGH] Would not work on PHP 7.2 because Composer adds a PHP version check.
# [MEDIUM] Joomla 4: admin 2SV takes you back to the frontend instead of the backend Control Panel page.
# [LOW] Remember me cookie not removed when logging out
