DO NOT FILE SECURITY ISSUES AS PUBLIC ISSUES

Reporting a potential security issue in a public GitHub issue is a disservice to the community. It may put users of this software, including yourself, at great risk.

If you want to report a security issue please refer to the Security tab of this repository and report the issue privately.
