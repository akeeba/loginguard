<h3>What's new?</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Added passwordless to the Silent login authentication response types</strong>.
	When you are using Joomla 4's WebAuthn or SocialLogin to log into your site you will not be asked for Two Step
	Verification. This makes sense because you're either using a cryptograhpically secure login method or you have
	already undergone a second authentication factor check on the third party site.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Updated WebAuthn</strong>. After upgrading Joomla 4 to a newer version of the Web Authentication
	framework I have done the same for LoginGuard. Not only does this make it compatible with Joomla 4, it also allows
	you to use device authenticators such as FaceID (iOS, iPadOS), TouchID (macOS, iOS, iPadOS), fingerprint (Android)
	and Windows Hello (Windows 10). FaceID/TouchID require Safari 14 running on iOS 14, iPadOS 14 or macOS Big Sur.
	Like before, you can still use TouchID on MacBook Pro and Air computers with a fingerprint sensor using Chrome on
    earlier versions of macOS.

	<strong>Bug fixes and minor improvements</strong>. Please take a look at the CHANGELOG below.
</p>

<h3>Joomla! versions supported</h3>
<p>
	We only officially support using our software with the latest Joomla! release branch, 3.9. We strongly advise you to run the latest available version of Joomla! for security reasons. Older versions of Joomla! have known major security issues which are being actively exploited to hack sites.
</p>
<p>
	Our software should run on Joomla 4.0 which is currently in Beta. Please note that Joomla 4 is not stable yet. It
	should not be used on production sites. Some breakage is expected; we are working on fixing issues on Joomla 4 but
	it may take a while since it's still changing, albeit not at the rate it was changing pre-Beta.
</p>

<h3>PHP versions supported</h3>
<p>
	We only officially support using our software with PHP 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 or 7.4. We strongly advise you to run the latest available version of PHP on a branch currently maintained by the PHP project for security reasons. Older versions of PHP have known major security issues which are being actively exploited to hack sites and they have stopped receiving security updates, leaving you exposed to these issues.
</p>
<p>
	Please note that earlier PHP versions including but not limited to PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 7.0 are no longer supported and our software no longer works on them.
