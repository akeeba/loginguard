<h3>What's new?</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Darker Dark Mode</strong>.
	Our Dark Mode was intentionally designed to be somewhat bright. This had two side-effects. On one hand it was brighter than the dark templates most people would use. Moreover, the contrast between the background and the text was inadequate for people with vision-related disabilities. Considering that Dark Mode is (also) an accessibility feature we addressed this concern.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Joomla 4 improvements</strong>.
	We applied necessary changes in our code to support Joomla 4 beta 7. Along with that came a few unexpected but welcome improvements. Labels in the tabbed interface elements are more legible. Custom selects are now rendered as native selects. Checkboxes are rendered as native chackboxes. Long lists and multiselect lists are back into using Chosen for easier item selection.

<p>
	<strong>Bug fixes and minor improvements</strong>. Please take a look at the CHANGELOG below.
