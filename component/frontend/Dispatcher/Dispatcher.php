		 * If a system plugin is loaded before LoginGuard and tries to load CSS, JS or image files which do not exists
		 * on the server on a site with URL rewrite code enabled in the .htaccess / web.config / NginX configuration
		 * file these missing files are routed to Joomla's index.php. This causes the LoginGuard system plugin to
		 * internally redirect the application to com_loginguard's Captive view. If the code by email / SMS plugin is
		 * set to be the default method its onLoginGuardTfaCaptive method is called and an email / SMS with the code is
		 * sent out **for each and every missing file handled by Joomla**.
		 *
		 * The workaround here examines the HTTP Accept header. Only those requests with an Accept header that includes
		 * text/html will be processed. Everything else will result in a crude 404, preventing the call to
		 * onLoginGuardTfaCaptive, therefore preventing the multiple sending of the login code by email / SMS.
		 *
		 * There is still one mode of failure. If a third party plugin includes JS which tries to perform an
		 * XMLHttpRequest with a text/html accept header we will process it, triggering another sending of the login
		 * code. There is no way to fix without Joomla adding proper support for captive logins as I had explained back
		 * in 2012 (at JoomlaDay France, IIRC).
